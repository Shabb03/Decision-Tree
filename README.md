# Decision-Tree
A decision tree built in python for my 4th year module CA4010, Data Mining

The aim is to predict the accuracy based on certain attributes if a person does or does not have a heart disease.
The dataset has been sourced from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bharath011/heart-disease-classification-dataset]
The prediction model has an accuracy of 98.57% with an average time of 28s for the given dataset with 1200 rows


### Tools used:
> Kaggle: Dataset Source
> Microsoft Excel: Dataset
> R-Studio: Analyse the dataâ€™s central tendency
> Python: Language used to code the prediction model
> Decision Tree: Algorithm Implemented to calculate the classification


### Algorithm used:
> Top-down induction of decision trees
> Gini index
> Gini Impurity
